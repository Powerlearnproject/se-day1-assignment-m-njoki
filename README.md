Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
The systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
Enables creation of software applications and systems that are used in areas eg. communication
This meets users needs, leads to innovation and reduces development costs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages eg.Fortran - abstracting machine complexity
Rise of object-oriented programming - introduce concepts eg. classes,objects, inheritance
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s - allowed iterative approach in development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Reuirements - Document user needs and system  requirements
Design - Create design for the User Interface and entire system
Implementation - Writing code to meet its specifications.
Testing  - Conduct tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment - Release software to users 
Maintenance - Provide support and updates to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology has a sequential approach with distinct phases eg. requirements, design before moving to the next while agile methodology has iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and collaboration of customer.
Waterfall -  critical systems that need strict documentation
Agile - web apps for startups


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -  Writes code to build the software.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager - Oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments - Software that provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg. Visual Studio
Version Control Systems - Software for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements during the development cycle leading to project delays.
Tight deadlines resulting in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - Test individual modules of software
Integration - Test interaction between different components
System - Test entire system as a whole
Acceptance - Test software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Crafting questions and statements to get the best responses from language models.
Improving  accuracy and relevance in responses given.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Give me information about cars
Explain differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars, including their environmental impact, cost, and performance

The second prompt is clear and specific thus receives a better response.
